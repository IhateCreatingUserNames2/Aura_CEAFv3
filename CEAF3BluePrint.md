# Aura Multi-Agent System (CEAF V3)

Aura is an advanced platform for creating and managing sophisticated AI agents, built on the Coherent Emergence Architecture Framework V3 (CEAF). This system is designed to enable agents to develop emergent identities, perform complex ethical reasoning, and self-optimize over time through reflection on their own experiences.

The primary goal of CEAF is not merely to produce responses, but to synthesize responses from multiple internal cognitive signals, enabling more robust, coherent, and principle-aligned behavior.

## Core Concepts

### 1. CEAF (Coherent Emergence Architecture Framework)

CEAF is a "synthesis" architecture, not a pipeline. Instead of passing data linearly through a series of stages, CEAF treats each module as a signal generator. The agent's cognitive state flows between modules, which enrich it with analysis and guidance. The final decision emerges from the synthesis of these signals, orchestrated by the CEAFSystem. This allows the agent to dynamically balance coherence (staying on topic), novelty (exploring new ideas), ethical safety, and long-term objectives.

### 2. Genlang (Generative Language)

Genlang is the "internal language" of the CEAF system. It's not a text language, but a set of standardized data structures (using Pydantic) that represent the agent's mental state and reasoning flow. The fundamental unit is the GenlangVector, which combines a semantic vector (embedding) with its source text and metadata.

Key Genlang "packets" include:

- **IntentPacket**: Represents the user's query translated into the semantic domain, including intention, emotion, and entities.

- **CognitiveStatePacket**: The agent's "mental state" at a given moment. Contains the original intent, activated memories, the current identity vector, and metacognitive guidance.

- **GuidancePacket**: Generated by the MCL, guides the agent's reasoning by "pulling" it toward coherence or novelty.

- **ResponsePacket**: The "pre-rendered" response in Genlang format, containing the essence of content, emotional tone, and confidence, before being translated to human language.

- **RefinementPacket**: Generated by the VRE, contains instructions (vectorial and textual) to correct or improve a ResponsePacket that didn't meet ethical or coherence standards.

## Architecture and Processing Flow

The heart of the system is the **CEAFSystem**, which orchestrates the flow of a single conversation turn.

The flow of a user query is as follows:

1. **Translation (Human to Genlang)**: The HumanToGenlangTranslator receives the user's string and converts it into a rich IntentPacket, using an LLM to analyze intent and emotion.

2. **Cognitive State Construction**: The CEAFSystem builds the initial CognitiveStatePacket, retrieving the agent's self-model (CeafSelfRepresentation) from NCIM and fetching relevant memories from MBSMemoryService.

3. **Deliberation Loop (Reasoning)**: The system enters a loop that may last several iterations:
   - **a. Metacognitive Guidance (MCL)**: The MCLEngine analyzes the CognitiveStatePacket and generates a GuidancePacket. It calculates an agency_score to decide whether the agent should follow a quick, direct response path or a deep deliberation path (agency_path).
   - **b. Agency Decision (Agency Module)**: The AgencyModule is activated. It generates multiple candidate actions (a direct response or tool use). It then simulates probable futures for each candidate, evaluates these futures based on coherence, alignment, and information gain, and selects the best strategic action.
   - **c. Tool Execution**: If the best action is to use a tool (e.g., query_long_term_memory), the tool is executed, the result is added to the CognitiveStatePacket, and the deliberation loop restarts with this new information.
   - **d. Response Generation**: If the best action is to respond, the corresponding ResponsePacket is selected and the deliberation loop ends.

4. **Evaluation and Refinement (VRE)**: The VREEngineV3 evaluates the final ResponsePacket against ethical principles and epistemic humility. If issues are found, it generates a RefinementPacket.

5. **Refinement (Refinement Module)**: If a RefinementPacket was generated, the RefinementModule uses it to rewrite the ResponsePacket, incorporating necessary corrections.

6. **Translation (Genlang to Human)**: The GenlangToHumanTranslator receives the final ResponsePacket and "renders" it into a natural, cohesive text response, adopting the persona defined in the agent's self-model.

7. **Post-Processing (Asynchronous)**: In the background, CEAFSystem initiates learning tasks:
   - **NCIM**: Updates the agent's self-model based on the interaction.
   - **LCAM**: Analyzes whether the interaction was a "failure" and, if so, creates a learning memory.
   - **MBS**: Creates a memory about the interaction for future reference.
   - **CognitiveLogService**: Saves all Genlang packets from the turn for later analysis by the AuraReflector.

## System Components

### CEAF Core (ceaf_core)

The ceaf_core is the system's brain, containing the core architectural logic.

#### CEAFSystem
The central orchestrator. The CEAFSystem class (ceaf_core/system.py) initializes all modules and manages the end-to-end processing flow for each interaction.

#### Core Modules

**MCL (Meta-Cognitive Loop) Engine**: The agent's "director." Analyzes the current cognitive state and decides the reasoning strategy. It determines whether a query is simple enough for a direct response or complex enough to require deep deliberation from the AgencyModule. It produces the GuidancePacket that guides other modules.

**Agency Module**: The agent's "strategist," responsible for deliberation and complex decision-making. Its primary function is Future Simulation:
- **Candidate Generation**: Generates multiple possible actions (respond, use a tool).
- **Trajectory Projection**: Simulates probable conversational outcomes for each candidate action.
- **Path Evaluation**: Scores each simulated future based on coherence, identity alignment, information gain, and safety, to choose the action with the highest expected value.

**VRE (Virtue Reasoning Engine)**: The agent's "ethical governor." It evaluates proposed responses against a framework of ethical principles, such as harm prevention, justice, and transparency. Also includes the EpistemicHumilityModule to ensure the agent doesn't make overly confident claims. If a response is deemed inadequate, the VRE generates a RefinementPacket to correct it.

**NCIM (Narrative Coherence & Identity Module)**: The "identity guardian." This module manages the CeafSelfRepresentation, the agent's self-model that defines its values, perceived capabilities, limitations, and persona. After each interaction, NCIM reflects on performance and updates the self-model, allowing the agent's identity to evolve coherently over time.

**LCAM (Loss Cataloging and Analysis Module)**: The "failure analyst." LCAM monitors interactions, especially VRE feedback, to identify when a response was "unsuccessful." It then creates a "failure memory," detailing what went wrong, so the agent can avoid similar mistakes in the future.

**Memory Blossom (MBS)**: The agent's memory system. It's more than a simple database; it's a living experience management system.
- **Memory Types**: Supports a rich variety of memory types, including ExplicitMemory (facts), EmotionalMemory (emotional states), ProceduralMemory (procedures), GoalRecord (objectives), and a Knowledge Graph (KGEntityRecord, KGRelationRecord).
- **Memory Lifecycle**: Memories have a dynamic_salience_score that's updated with each access. The MemoryLifecycleManager applies decay over time, allowing less relevant memories to be archived or forgotten, keeping the memory system efficient.
- **Advanced Synthesizer**: A powerful tool capable of clustering memories by theme and "weaving" cohesive narratives and summaries from them, primarily used by the AuraReflector to generate insights.

**Refinement Module**: The "editor." When the VRE signals a problem in a response, this module receives the RefinementPacket and uses an LLM to rewrite the response, naturally incorporating necessary corrections.

#### Aura Reflector

The AuraReflector (ceaf_core/background_tasks/aura_reflector.py) is a crucial background process for agent self-optimization. It analyzes the turn history recorded by the CognitiveLogService to:

- **Detect Patterns**: Identifies success and failure patterns (e.g., when does the agent perform best? In "productive confusion" or "stable operation" states?).
- **Self-Tuning**: Based on these patterns, it adjusts the agent's dynamic configuration (ceaf_dynamic_config.json), modifying parameters like agency_threshold or coherence/novelty weights to optimize future performance.
- **Meta-Memory Synthesis**: Uses the AdvancedMemorySynthesizer to analyze clusters of recent memories and create high-level "meta-memories," representing learned lessons or emerging themes.

### Services (ceaf_core/services)

**MBSMemoryService**: The concrete, persistent implementation of the Memory Blossom system. Manages storage in .jsonl files, in-memory cache, and embedding cache.

**LLMService**: A centralized wrapper for making calls to language models via LiteLLM. Abstracts API logic, allowing modules to treat LLMs as tools.

**CognitiveLogService**: A robust service using SQLite to log the CognitiveStatePacket, ResponsePacket, and mcl_guidance for each turn, creating a "flight log" for the agent's cognition, which serves as the data source for the AuraReflector.

### Utilities (ceaf_core/utils)

A set of helper functions for common tasks throughout the system, such as:

- **embedding_utils.py**: Provides an EmbeddingClient for generating embeddings consistently.
- **common_utils.py**: Functions for extracting JSON from LLM text, sanitizing logs, etc.
- **observability_types.py**: Defines data structures for internal agent observability.

## Supporting Systems

**AgentManager** (agent_manager.py): The top-level management layer. Responsible for creating, loading, listing, and deleting agent instances (CEAFSystem). It manages the persistence of configurations and data for each agent in its own directory.

**API (FastAPI)** (api/routes.py): The web interface for the Aura system. Exposes RESTful endpoints for all AgentManager functionalities and for interacting with agents (e.g., /agents, /agents/{agent_id}/chat).

**Database (SQLAlchemy)** (database/models.py): Manages relational data, such as user accounts, high-level agent configurations, and chat session history. It's distinct from each agent's memory system (MBS).

**Prebuilt Agents System** (prebuilt_agents_system.py): Allows the creation of "template agents" with predefined personalities, archetypes (Philosopher, Creative, etc.), and initial memories. Users can clone these agents to quickly start their journey.

**WhatsApp Bridge** (whatsapp_bridge/): A separate service that acts as a bridge between the WhatsApp Business API and the Aura API. It allows users to interact with their Aura agents directly through WhatsApp messages, translating text commands (e.g., !select <agent>) into API calls.

## Reality Score: Bridging Simulation and Reality

The Reality Score is a self-calibration mechanism designed to evaluate and improve the accuracy of the AgencyModule's future simulations.

### How It Works

The Reality Score measures how well the agent's predictions about conversation continuations match what the user actually says, functioning as a "reality checker" for the AgencyModule.

1. **Prediction**: When the AgencyModule runs a future simulation for a candidate response, it also predicts the user's most likely response. This prediction is stored in the current chat session data.

2. **Comparison**: In the next turn, when the user's actual response is received, the CEAFSystem compares it with the prediction stored from the previous turn.

3. **Score Calculation**: The semantic similarity between the predicted response and the actual response is calculated using embeddings.

4. **Average Update**: This new similarity score is used to update the agent's overall "Reality Score," which is an Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This ensures the reality score gradually adjusts over time, reflecting recent simulation performance rather than being drastically altered by a single inaccurate prediction.

### System Impact

The most critical consequence of the Reality Score is its function as a safety and efficiency mechanism in the MCLEngine.

**Agency Cancellation (Agency Override)**: The MCLEngine checks the current Reality Score before activating the deep deliberation path (agency). If the Reality Score is below a configurable activation threshold, agency simulation is disabled for that turn, even if the agency_score is high.

**Rationale**: This measure prevents the agent from spending computational resources (and consequently, user credits) on future simulations that have consistently proven inaccurate. Essentially, if the agent cannot predict user reactions well, it's forced to adopt a simpler, more direct response path until its simulation capability improves.

This new component adds a layer of adaptive learning to the agent's deliberative core, directly connecting the accuracy of its internal predictions to its strategic behavior, making the system more robust and efficient.
